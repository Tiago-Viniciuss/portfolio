            <h2>Perspective:</h2>
            <p>
                Since I started my new career as a developer, many challenges have crossed my path. One of the first was: <i><strong>"What is my market vision?"</strong></i> I went to my bed every night thinking about it. <i><strong>"What do I need to do differently?"</strong></i> <br> Now, I know that each new project is a new challenge, so the best way to reach the goal is to learn more every day and look for new solutions, not only for the languages (<i>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.</i>), but also for the design, user experience and more. Below, you can check out some projects I've done following this perspective.

            <h2>Infectus MC</h2>
            <p>This is a website I developed for the brazilian motorcycle club I'm a member of. I prioritized the <i>darker</i> and <i>drier style</i>, since we are talking about a traditional motorcycle club with rock and roll references. The site is adapted for mobile version, tablet screens and for desktops/laptops. This was a challenging project as it was the <strong>first real project I did</strong>. <br>Obs.: I am still making changes to the site, so it's not ready yet.</p>

            <h2>Restaurante Graciliano</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently living in Portugal. And one of the best things here is, of course, the food. And making a Portuguese restaurant was a good idea in my head. I made the website in a smooth style, with beautiful photos and an amazing fictional story about the foundation. This project is also adapted for different screen resolutions. Check it out!

            <h2>Razortech Website</h2>
            <p>
                It was a pleasure to do this little project. I did it in exactly 15 hours. In this one, I played with the colors, login screen, buttons and much more.  The goal was to make a login screen with username and password validation and some content inside it. In this case, I made an educational content, talking about IT languages.
