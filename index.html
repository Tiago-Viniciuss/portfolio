            <h3>What convinces you?</h3>
            <p>Appearence? Usability? Brand?Functionality? Value message? There are just some examples of things an ordinary person observes when buying a product or an idea. And a good design is the most complete union of all these elements above.</p>

        <div class="info" id="div3">
            <h3>Choose <a href="#">one</a>:</h3>
        </div>
            <div class="info" id="div4">
                <p>This is an common case of choice by emotional reason. <br> <br> " <i>The people smiling, a happy place and the image is attractive.</i> "</p>
            </div>
            <div class="info" id="div5">
                <p>
                    You probably didn't choose this image first because: <br> <br> " <i>The image is blurry, visibility is poor and people are in a bad mood.</i> "
                </p>
            </div>
        <div class="info" id="div6">
            <p>
                I know, that was a very simple example. But, remember: <strong>Design doesn't have to be complicated</strong>. <br> You chose the image on your mind in the first 5 seconds. One of the reasons for your choice is the <strong>emotion</strong>. We are emotional beings, so we tend, in 90% of the cases, to follow this emotional side (unconsciously). And one of the best ways to convince us to buy an idea is through the emotion it causes. <a href="#">Design causes emotion.</a>
